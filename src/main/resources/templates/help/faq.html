                                    A: The basic idea behind this service is simple: we allow people to upload
                                    potentially large files (although not <a href="#size">too large</a>) to our
                                    servers, where they will be stored for a limited period. Once the files
                                    have been completely uploaded, we send an email containing a download
                                    URL to the address or UH username you have specified as the recipient.
                                    That's it, in a nutshell.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There are, of course, a few additional complications.  First,
                                    this service is provided to the UH community, and is not meant to be
                                    open to the general public.  However, we do wish to provide the ability
                                    for people unaffiliated with the University to use the service to share
                                    files with people within UH.  In all cases, we require at least one end
                                    of the transaction (sender or receiver, that is) to be UH staff or faculty.
                                    The only practical consequence of this is that for a UH person to send
                                    files to a non-UH person, the UH person <strong>must</strong> use the
                                    link on the service home page to login prior to uploading files.
                                </p>
                            </td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td align="left" valign="top" class="faq-question">Q: I am having problems logging in.</td>

                                    A: Please try closing and re-opening your browser, which usually
                                    corrects a number of problems with how your browser stores login
                                    information.
                                </p>

                            <td align="left" valign="top" class="faq-question">Q: Can I send files to multiple recipients?</td>
                            <td align="left" valign="top">

                                    A: You cannot directly use the service to send files to multiple
                                    recipients.  When filling in the recipient form, you must provide
                                    only a single email address or UH Username.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    However, if you are a UH user using the service to upload files, you can
                                    effectively send the files to multiple recipients.  Once the upload
                                    has completed, the resulting page will contain the link to download
                                    the files.  You can copy that link and share any way you like.
                                    For example, you can email the link to multiple recipients.  In fact
                                    (here is a little secret), if you are UH staff or faculty you don't even need
                                    to provide a recipient in the form: you can leave the recipient blank,
                                    in which case no email will be sent and it will be up to you to send
                                    then download URL to your intended recipients.
                                </p>

                                    There are a few restrictions on the service. The total size of the
                                    upload must not exceed <span th:text="${maxSize}"></span>MB. 
                                    You can use the service as many times as you like, but any 
                                    single upload cannot exceed that size. Also, we provide
                                    the files for download for a limited time only.  Finally, the use of
                                    the service must comply with all relevant University policies,
                                    including
                                    <a href="https://www.hawaii.edu/policy/?action=viewPolicy&amp;policySection=ep&amp;policyChapter=2&amp;policyNumber=210" target="_e2210">E2.210</a>.

                                    For obvious reasons, it's important to be aware of these restrictions,
                                    particularly the limited download time window.  If you are using the
                                    service to upload files, you must clearly inform the recipients that
                                    they must download the files prior to the closure of this window.
                                </p>

                                    Currently, the files will be available for 1 to 7 days.  A

                                    expired will be displayed once the upload is completed.  Also,
                                    both the confirmation email sent to you (the uploader) and
                                    the email sent by the system to your recipient will contain
                                    the expiration date and time.

                                    Even in the basic operation described above, the file transfer (both
                                    in uploading and downloading) is secure, in the sense that "SSL"
                                    is used to encrypt the traffic.  This should provide sufficient security
                                    for most users.  However, it's true that in the basic mode of operation
                                    the security of the system depends entirely on the obscurity of the
                                    randomly generated URLs used to download the files.  It is extremely
                                    unlikely that anyone would be able to guess one of these URLs.   But
                                    there may be other ways for an attacker to learn the download URL,
                                    and since in the basic mode of operation that's all we require to
                                    download the files, the attacker would gain access to the files.
                                </p>

                                    We do offer an additional level of protection, for users exchanging files
                                    containing sensitive information.  When uploading files, you can
                                    check off the <span style="font-style: italic">"Require Authentication"</span>
                                    checkbox.  If this checkbox is selected, the UH user who is the recipient
                                    of the transfer will have to login before retrieving the files. That is,
                                    the recipient must know both the secret URL and the recipient's UH Username
                                    and password.  The recipient must correspond to a UH user. If you would
                                    like your departmental email address to be included in those that can
                                    require authentication, please use the Feedback form to send a message to
